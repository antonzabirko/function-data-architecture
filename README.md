# Introduction to Systemic Program Design

Following along [the course](https://www.edx.org/course/how-code-simple-data-ubcx-htc1x) by **Gregor Kiczales**.

Each topic within the course has its' own folder, inherited directly from the course's structure.

'Classwork' folders contain Racket files that Kiczales covers in the videos.
'Homework' folders contain Racket files that are recommended as extra work after each module.
'src' folders contain the source code for the assignments. This is useful for programs that literally reference images.

Semantic versioning is used for each release. Unfortunately there can be no meaningful releases, so the versions will stay at 0.0.X as X approaches to infinity... and beyond!
