# Systemic Program Design

Following along [the course](https://www.edx.org/course/how-code-simple-data-ubcx-htc1x) by **Gregor Kiczales**.

Semantic versioning is used for each release. Unfortunately there can be no meaningful releases, so the versions will stay at 0.0.X as X approaches to infinity... and beyond!
